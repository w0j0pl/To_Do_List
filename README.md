# To_Do_List

A simple to do list in which you can add, remove, edit, mark as done/undone and mark as important/unimportant tasks. This manager creates a .json file with your tasks in the directory where main.py is.

To make important tasks yellow I used a colored library.
So to make it work you have to install it writing: "pip install colored" to your terminal and pressing Enter.

Project is still in progress
